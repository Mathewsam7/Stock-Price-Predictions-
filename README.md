# Stock-Price-Predictions-
## The provided file contains historical data of stock prices for multiple stocks over a specified time period. Each row represents a single day, and each column represents the closing price of a specific stock on that day. The dataset allows for analysis of stock price movements, trends, correlations, and other factors influencing the stock market.
## What is Stock Price Prediction?
#### Stock price prediction involves using historical data to forecast future price movements of a particular stock. It's a complex task influenced by numerous factors like economic indicators, company performance, market sentiment, and global events.

## Why Python for Stock Price Prediction?
 #### Python's versatility, coupled with a rich ecosystem of libraries, makes it an ideal choice for data analysis and machine learning tasks, including stock price prediction.

## Key Libraries for Stock Price Prediction:
## Data Handling and Analysis:

### NumPy (np): Efficient numerical operations on arrays.
### Pandas (pd): Data analysis and manipulation, reading/writing data, data cleaning, and exploration.
### Matplotlib (plt): Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
### Seaborn (sns): Statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib.

## Machine Learning:

### Scikit-learn (sklearn):MinMaxScaler: Feature scaling.
### train_test_split: Data splitting.
### GridSearchCV: Hyperparameter tuning.
### KNeighborsRegressor: K-Nearest Neighbors regression.
### XGBRegressor: Gradient Boosting Regression.
### RandomForestRegressor: Random Forest Regression.
### LinearRegression: Linear Regression.
### mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score: Evaluation metrics.

## Predictive Modeling
### Data Import and Preparation: Use Pandas to read and preprocess data.
### Feature Engineering: Create or transform features, use MinMaxScaler.
### Model Selection and Training: Split data, experiment with models, tune hyperparameters, and train.
### Model Evaluation: Make predictions, evaluate with metrics.
### Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize data and results.

## Data Preprocessing:

It converts the "date" column to a proper date format using pd.to_datetime.
Then, it drops the "date" column (assuming it's not relevant for correlation analysis) to create data_for_corr.

## Correlation Heatmap:

It calculates the correlation matrix using data_for_corr.corr().
Finally, it uses Seaborn to plot a heatmap with color-coded squares representing the correlation strength between features. The code also adds annotations within the squares for easier interpretation. 

### Then code performs machine learning model selection and evaluation for regression tasks.

## Data Splitting and Hyperparameter Tuning:

It splits data into training and testing sets.
Then, it uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for K Neighbors Regressor (KNN), XGBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression models.

## Model Evaluation:

The code trains the best models with the optimized hyperparameters and makes predictions on the test set.
Finally, it evaluates the performance of each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score.

## Desired Output:
The code outputs the best performing model's hyperparameters and its evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R-squared) for each model (KNN, XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression). This allows you to compare the models and choose the one that performs best on your specific dataset.
